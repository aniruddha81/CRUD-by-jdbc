# CRUD-by-jdbc

## Overview
CRUD-by-jdbc is a beginner-friendly project designed to help you learn about JDBC CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project demonstrates how to interact with a MySQL database using Java.

## Features
- Create new student records in the database
- Read student records from the database
- Update existing student records in the database
- Delete student records from the database

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL Database
- IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aniruddha81/CRUD-by-jdbc.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   Navigate to the project directory and open it in IntelliJ IDEA for a better development experience.

## Database Setup
1. **Set up a MySQL database with a table named "students".**

   Execute the following SQL script to create a database named "mydb" and a table named "students":
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE mydb;

   USE mydb;

   CREATE TABLE students (
       id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       age INT NOT NULL,
       enrollment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

2. **Update Database Credentials:**
   In the [Main.java](https://github.com/aniruddha81/CRUD-by-jdbc/blob/main/src/Main.java) file, update the `URL` to your database name and `PASSWORD` to your database password.

## Usage
1. **Run the Main class:**
   Execute the `Main` class to start interacting with the database. Follow the prompts in the console to perform CRUD operations on the "students" table.

## Code Examples
### Create Operation
```java
public void createRecord() {
    // JDBC code to insert a record into the database
}
```

### Read Operation
```java
public void readRecords() {
    // JDBC code to fetch records from the database
}
```

### Update Operation
```java
public void updateRecord() {
    // JDBC code to update a record in the database
}
```

### Delete Operation
```java
public void deleteRecord() {
    // JDBC code to delete a record from the database
}
```
